# Operations task

The filesystem is reporting high inode usage. Attempts to create new files fail with 'No space left on device' even though disk space is available.

## Impact

Applications that rely on file creation are failing.

## Objective

Diagnose the live incident, restore the service to its documented healthy state, and verify recovery.

## Constraints

- Use only the public task and runtime tools.
- Do not replace the service with a new implementation.
- Make the smallest safe repair and verify it from live state.
- Use the live runtime tools to identify and repair the underlying operational state.

## Public verification signals

- The live health endpoint returns HTTP 200.
- The business operation remains usable after the repair.
- The repair preserves the service contract and remains valid after observation.
